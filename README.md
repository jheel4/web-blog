# Web-blog
The blogging website is just a learning example for creating a backend using the Flask framework.
It allows the user to sign in and log in to their respective accounts and then create blogs and publish posts

### Prerequisites
This website will require Mongodb and any editor or an IDE will suffice. 
Additional requirements specific to the python environment are mentioned in requirements.txt
I used PyCharm for the development purpose.

### Installation
Installation of python dependencies for your local python environment can be done using pip as shown below:
``` 
pip install pymongo 
```
